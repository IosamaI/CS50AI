# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This is an implementation of a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the user plays against an unbeatable AI using the Minimax algorithm. The AI uses this algorithm to make optimal moves, ensuring it never loses (if both players play optimally). The game features a graphical interface built with Pygame, making it interactive and visually appealing.

## Distinctiveness and Complexity

This project uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make decisions for the AI. Minimax is a recursive algorithm that evaluates every possible move in the game and selects the one that maximizes the AI's chances of winning, while minimizing the opponent's chances. This ensures that the AI plays optimally and never loses, unless the user does not play optimally.

The integration of the **Pygame** library adds a level of complexity, as it enables a graphical user interface that allows players to interact with the game through clicks. The game is dynamic, with real-time updates to the board after each move.
