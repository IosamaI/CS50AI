## Overview

CS50AI explores the foundations of artificial intelligence and teaches practical applications using Python. Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience with concepts such as search algorithms, machine learning, natural language processing, and more.

This repository includes the following projects:

### 1. **Knights**
   - **Description**: Solve logical puzzles using propositional logic and knowledge representation.
   - **Key Concepts**: Knowledge engineering, logical inference.

### 2. **Minesweeper**
   - **Description**: Implement an AI to play Minesweeper by inferring safe moves and mines based on probabilities.
   - **Key Concepts**: Propositional logic, probability, constraint satisfaction.

### 3. **Sudoku**
   - **Description**: Create an AI to solve Sudoku puzzles using backtracking search and constraint propagation.
   - **Key Concepts**: Search algorithms, optimization.

### 4. **Shopping**
   - **Description**: Predict customer purchasing behaviors using machine learning models.
   - **Key Concepts**: Supervised learning, feature engineering.

### 5. **Nim**
   - **Description**: Build an AI to play the game of Nim using reinforcement learning.
   - **Key Concepts**: Q-learning, decision-making.

### 6. **Parser**
   - **Description**: Develop a natural language parser to identify noun phrases in text.
   - **Key Concepts**: Natural language processing, context-free grammars.
